# Website Copy Improvement

Welcome to the **Website Copy Improvement** repository! This is a simple tool built with Wordware to designed to analyze website copy and suggest improvements. Simply provide a URL, and the tool will generate structured feedback on what can be enhanced in the site's text content.

## Overview

It was created in a hacky way when working on Wordware, where structured outputs were not working well, and there was no existing frontend solution. The goal is to provide users with actionable insights on improving their website's copy, helping to enhance clarity, engagement, and overall user experience.
